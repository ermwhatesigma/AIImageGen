# AIImageGen
This is another project i made that uses an ollama ai model dolphin-phi to make the prompt split into frames. And then it passes those frame prompts into an image gen this time an SDXL from huggingface and then uses ffmpeg to fuse the frames into a video it will also safe the frames into the folder.
